# NOTE: This Dockerfile uses BuildKit features (the `--mount=type=bind` form in the
# `RUN` instruction). To build locally you must enable BuildKit, for example:
#
#   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t multi-container-app:dev ./app
#
# If you cannot use BuildKit, remove the `--mount=type=bind` / `--mount=type=cache`
# usages and replace them with standard COPY steps. The current file is optimized
# for a fast developer rebuild flow when BuildKit is available.
