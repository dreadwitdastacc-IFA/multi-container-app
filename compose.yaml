# Here the instructions define your application as two services called "todo-app" and “todo-database”
# The service “todo-app” is built from the Dockerfile in the /app directory,
# and the service “todo-database” uses the official MongoDB image 
# from Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo. 
# You can add other services your application may depend on here.

      # production runs we disable livereload by default to avoid requiring

    # By default we use a named volume `database` to persist MongoDB data.
    # If you want the database files to live on the host (for more storage space
    # or easier inspection), set the HOST_DB_PATH environment variable when
    # running Compose. Example:
    #
    #   HOST_DB_PATH=/mnt/big-disk/docker-mongo-data docker compose up -d
    #
    # The service volume below uses variable substitution: if HOST_DB_PATH is
    # set it will be bound as a host path, otherwise a named volume `database`
    # will be created.
